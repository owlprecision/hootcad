# HootCAD Roadmap

## Vision

Bring **professional software engineering workflows** to CAD - source control, automation, code review, and CI/CD for design.

## Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1-2: Core Foundation (Complete)
- JSCAD execution pipeline
- 3D rendering with interactive preview
- Parametric UI with live updates
- Multi-format export (STL, OBJ, AMF, DXF, SVG, JSON, X3D)

### 🔄 Phase 3: Enhanced Rendering
- Improved lighting, edges, and visual quality
- Better orientation cues and grid system

### 🔄 Phase 4: Production Workflows
- Headless export for CI/CD
- Automated build pipelines
- Deterministic output for manufacturing

### 🔄 Phase 5: TypeScript CAD
- First-class `.tscad` file support
- Strong typing and IDE integration
- Scaffolding and zero-config builds

### 🔄 Phase 6: OpenCascade Integration
- B-rep geometry support
- STEP format export
- Manufacturing-grade precision

### 🔄 Phase 7: AI-Assisted Design
- Enhanced MCP tools for coding agents
- Geometry validation and constraints
- Automated design review

## Contributing

This roadmap is a living document. Contributions are welcome at any phase:

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/owlprecision/hootcad/issues)
2. Open an issue to discuss your approach
3. Submit a PR with your implementation

## Why It Matters

**Design is code. Code is design.**

HootCAD unlocks:
- Version control with meaningful diffs
- Automated testing and validation
- Reproducible builds
- Code review for CAD models
- CI/CD for manufacturing
